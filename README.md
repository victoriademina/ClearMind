# ClearMind Chrome Extension
 
ClearMind is a Google Chrome extension that disables distracting elements on a webpage for easy focus and reading. 
This allows you to easily toggle the extension on and off as needed, restoring the original styling of the page.

## Installation 

To use ClearMind, download or clone the code and add the extension to your Chrome browser by following these steps:

1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
2. Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the upper right corner.
3. Click on "Load unpacked" in the upper left corner and select the ClearMind extension folder.

## Usage
Once installed, ClearMind can be activated by clicking on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. This will set the badge text to "OFF" and disable distracting elements on the current webpage. Clicking on the icon again will toggle the extension off, setting the badge text to "ON" and restoring the original webpage.
